#### Premise:
Money buckets keeps track of desposits via 'buckets', seperate units that represent a savings goal... a bill, multiple bills, a pair of shoes, vacation fund...any dollar amount labeled for a desired use.

Imagine that these buckets are stacked, one on top of the next.  A deposit is 'poured' into the top bucket and once it's filled (or when specific conditions have been met) left over funds 'flow' into the bucket below it, and so on.

Any number of buckets can be created, re-ordered, emptied out or poured into other buckets.  Once a bucket is filled up, it no longer accepts funds and passes everything down to the next bucket until it has been emptied or removed from the stack.

#### Stack:
- React
- Apollo with GraphQL
- Google Firestore
- UI - Material UI
